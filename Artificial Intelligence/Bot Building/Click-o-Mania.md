The best strategy is to avoid create valleys and to keep blocks grouped at the left wall. For exapmle, this priority function

min(number of one-blocks), min(number of multi-blocks), min(length of the removed block), max(column index of the removed block), min(row index of the removed block)

allows to solve the problem :-)
